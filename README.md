   - After installing the wizard if you want to check the Python version installed run the following command on a terminal.
   ```
   python â€“version
   ```
2. Dependencies installation: (Open a terminal on your code viewer)
   - Pandas
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```
   - Duckdb
   ```
   pip install duckdb
   ```
   - Pytest
   ```
   pip install pytest
   ```
